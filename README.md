# Placement Helper 

Placement Helper is a simple application designed to assist placement students at the University of Plymouth with their weekly logs (a suggestion to help with the reflective essay we're meant to write at the end of our placement). To be honest, I made it real quick to help myself specifically but I thought it'd be nice to share in case anyone else could get any use out of it! 

## Features 📋

- **Weekly Log Tracking**: Record/manage weekly logs including activity descriptions, durations, reflections, and feedback. There are prompts in the application's text boxes to help guide what you should write about.
- **Dark Theme**: The app colour scheme is pretty dark to save your eyeballs.
- **Date Picker**: Integrated date picker to easily keep track of when the log was for.
